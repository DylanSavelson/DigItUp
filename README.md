The user goes to a certain block on the map and mine it and then will have a random chance at any of the ores in the game. There will be a chance that the user gets explosive ore and if the user does not have a defuse kit (purchaseable from the shop) they will blow up and lose some ores/gems/coins and health. The shop will contain pickaxe upgrades, health potions and defuse kits all purchaseable for coins which are obtained by selling ores/gems.
