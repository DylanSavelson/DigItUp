# Dig It Up


## ‚úíÔ∏è Description

In this tycoon/simulator game, the player tries to mine different ores to get a better pickaxe and make coins. The user goes to a certain block on the map and mine it and then will have a random chance at any of the ores in the game. There will be a chance that the user gets explosive ore and if the user does not have a defuse kit (purchaseable from the shop) they will blow up and lose some ores/gems/coins and health. The shop will contain pickaxe upgrades, health potions and defuse kits all purchaseable for coins which are obtained by selling ores/gems. The goal of the game is to get the max pickaxe to escape the mine. The user will use w a s d to move and space bar to dig. To enter the shop it will be tab and mouse in the shop.


## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

Players begin with a low level pickaxe and must explore to find ore pockets and mine them. They must mine enough to upgrade a pickaxe which provides more loot when mining ores. The player can either sell or hold 
ores in the backpack with a limited amount of space per type of ore. If the user finds an explosive ore they will have to defuse it with a defuse kit bought from the shop, if it isn't defused, used can pay a certain amount of coins to try and defuse it but still a chance to explode and lose a % of hearts gems and coins.

### üßµ Wireframes

> [!note]
> Your wireframes don't have to be super polished. They can even be black/white and hand drawn. I'm just looking for a rough idea about what you're visualizing.

![Main Menu](./assets/images/Main-Menu.png)

-   _Let's Play_ will navigate to the main game.
-   _Upload Cards_ will navigation to the forms for uploading and parsing the data files for the game.
-   _Change Log_ will navigate the user to a page with a list of features/changes that have been implemented throughout the development of the game.

![Game Board](./assets/images/Game-Board.png)

We want to keep the GUI as simple and clear as possible by having cards with relevant images to act as a way for the user to intuitively navigate the game. We want to implement a layout that would look like as if one were playing a match of the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game with physical cards in real life. Clicking on any of the cards will reveal that card's details to the player.

### üé® Assets

We used [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create the wireframes. Wireframes are the equivalent to the skeleton of a web app since they are used to describe the functionality of the product and the users experience.

We plan on following trends already found in other trading card video games, such as Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Online, Hearthstone, Magic the Gathering Arena, and Gwent.

The GUI will be kept simple and playful, as to make sure the game is easy to understand what each component does and is, as well as light hearted to keep to the Pok√©mon theme.

#### üñºÔ∏è Images

-   Most images will be used from the well known community driven wikipedia site, [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page).
-   Especially their [Trading Card Game section](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Full_Art_card_(TCG)>).

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Fonts

For fonts, a simple sans-serif like Roboto will look quite nice. It's a font that is legible, light on storage size, and fun to keep with the theme we're going for. We also used a more cartoonish Pokemon font for the title screen.

-   [Pokemon](https://www.dafont.com/pokemon.font)
-   [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)

#### üîä Sounds

All sounds were taken from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) for the actions pertaining to cards.

-   [Shuffle cards](https://freesound.org/people/VKProduktion/sounds/217502/)
-   [Flip card](https://freesound.org/people/Splashdust/sounds/84322/)
